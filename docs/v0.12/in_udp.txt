# UDP Input Plugin

The `in_udp` Input plugin enables Fluentd to accept UDP payload.

## Example Configuration

`in_udp` is included in Fluentd's core. No additional installation process is required.

    :::text
    <source>
      @type udp
      tag mytag # required
      format /^(?<field1>\d+):(?<field2>\w+)$/ # required
      port 20001 # optional. 5160 by default
      bind 0.0.0.0 # optional. 0.0.0.0 by default
      body_size_limit 1MB # optional. 4096 bytes by default
    </source>

NOTE: Please see the <a href="config-file">Config File</a> article for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

## Parameters

#### type (required)
The value must be `udp`.

#### tag (required)
tag of output events.

#### port
The port to listen to. Default Value = 5160

#### bind
The bind address to listen to. Default Value = 0.0.0.0

#### source_host_key

The field name of the client's hostname. If set the value, the client's hostname will be set to its key. The default is nil (no adding hostname).

If you set following configuration:

    :::text
    source_host_key client_host

then the client's hostname is set to `client_host` field.

    :::text
    {
        ...
        "foo": "bar",
        "client_host": "client.hostname.org"
    }

#### format (required)
The format of the UDP payload.

## FAQ

### How to prevent request drop?

If in_udp gots lots of packets within 1 sec, some packets are dropped.
For example, you can see bigger RcvbufErrors number via `netstat -su`.

This means in_udp with one process can't handle such traffic.
Try [fluent-plugin-multiprocess](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-plugin-multiprocess) to resolve the problem. See [issue 1334](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/issues/1334) for more detail.
